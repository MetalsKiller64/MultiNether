MultiNether
===========

This is a plugin for fixing problems with the nether on a bukkit server with multiple worlds (e.g. via MultiVerse).
I've already tried out many things to fix those problems but nothing worked so far
and that's the reason why i've created this plugin. I'm trying to build it similar to the vanilla code, because i don't
want to make something new but just to fix a existing problem.
